    year: "Deep Learning",
    heading: "Neurological Disease Classifier",
    description: `I developed a neurological disease classifier using deep learning, designed to analyze medical data and accurately classify neurological conditions. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model design using neural networks, and performance tuning for optimal accuracy. This backend-focused implementation showcases my ability to apply deep learning techniques to real-world healthcare problems, emphasizing model reliability, evaluation metrics, and scalability for future integration.`,

  {
    year: "Large Language Model",
    heading: "Hiring Assistant",
    description: `I developed a hiring assistant chatbot using a local Ollama language model to conduct technical interviews. The assistant dynamically generates role-specific questions, evaluates candidate responses, and assigns scores based on the quality of answers. The results are stored in Firebase for easy tracking and analysis. For the frontend, I used Streamlit to build an interactive, user-friendly interface, enabling real-time interactions and data display.`,

  {
    year: "Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing",
    heading: "Poetry Generator",
    description: `I developed a poetry generator that takes a single input poem and generates new poetry in a similar tone and style, using a hybrid of Markov Chains for local structure and an RNN for capturing deeper patterns and flow. The system learns from the input on the fly, allowing for dynamic, tone-consistent poetic generation.`,

  {
    year: "Full Stack Devlopment",
    heading: "3D Animated Portfolio (Client Project)",
    description: `I developed an interactive 3D animation project using Spline integrated with a Next.js frontend. The project showcases smooth, real-time 3D visuals embedded seamlessly within a modern web interface, offering an engaging user experience. For the contact functionality, I implemented EmailJS, enabling users to send messages directly from the site without needing a backend.`,

  {
    year: "Full Stack Development",
    heading: "Animated Frontend Developement with Authentication",
    description: `I developed a practice project focused on animated frontend development, featuring custom mesh animations and smooth user interactions. For authentication, I used Clerk but built a fully custom sign-in and sign-up UI instead of relying on Clerkâ€™s default templates, allowing full control over the user experience and styling. This project helped me refine my skills in combining animation, authentication, and clean UI design in a modern frontend stack.`,
